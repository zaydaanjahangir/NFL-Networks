# CS4973_Final_Project
## Project Overview  
A brief description of what the project does and why.  
> **NFL Defensive Network Analysis** uses player tracking data and graph­-based algorithms (betweenness, clustering, centralities, robustness, etc.) to identify structural features of high‑impact defensive plays (e.g., sacks, forced turnovers) and correlate them with metrics like Defensive EPA.

## Key Features  
- Build weighted graphs of each play (vertices = players; edge weight = inverse distance)  
- Compute **weighted** centrality measures (betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, Katz, PageRank)  
- Calculate clustering coefficients, node strength, network density  
- Perform robustness simulations (node removal)  
- Correlate graph metrics with play outcomes (Defensive EPA, yards allowed, turnovers)  
- Temporal analysis: track metric evolution frame‑by‑frame
